Refine the existing CV Health Check interface.
Keep the calm, professional, Apple-like aesthetic, but apply the following specific adjustments:

1. Simplify the left-side “landing” panel

Remove the leaf icon entirely.

Remove the four category boxes (“Impact & Metrics,” “Role Alignment,” etc.).

Replace the right-side intro area with one simple block of text:

Header: “CV Health Check”
Subheader: “Upload a CV to receive concise, structured feedback.”
Body text (smaller): “The system evaluates clarity, relevance, and alignment.”

No icons. No decorative branding.

2. Strengthen the analysis panel structure

On the analysis/result screen (right side), add clean section headers:

“What’s working well”

“Where to strengthen”

“Optional rewrite sample”

Make them subtle, not loud — same typography scale as your current “Suggestions for Improvement” header, but with more whitespace.

Above all analysis content, add a tiny, subdued line:

“Based on a first-pass reading of the CV:”

This should look intentional and calm.

3. Remove all unneeded ornamentation

Do NOT show any logos or mascots.

No leaf, no icons, no branding beyond text.

Keep the color palette neutral (grey, white, soft green accent).

Ensure it feels like it could live inside an enterprise tool today.

4. Keep the micro-interaction (“Apply Change”)

Maintain the current “Apply Change” preview popover, but ensure it has:

Rounded corners

Calm color palette

Very simple copy

5. Upload screen adjustments

Keep the large “Upload CV” box centered on the left.

Ensure the right panel only displays the simple intro text block mentioned above.

Layout should feel empty and breathable, not busy.

6. Analysis screen scanning effect

Keep the subtle scanning animation over the CV preview, but ensure:

It’s faint

It moves slowly

It doesn’t look like sci-fi diagnostics

It should feel like a document being gently inspected.

7. CTA button

At the bottom of the analysis panel, keep the CTA:

“Suggest role alignment draft”

It must look optional and non-threatening:

small arrow icon

subtle outline or soft accent color

no heavy emphasis

8. Overall tone

The entire experience should communicate:

intentional restraint

precision

clarity

“We know exactly what we’re doing — and we’re not trying to impress you with gimmicks.”

This is a minimal, enterprise-friendly, low-risk v1 that delivers immediate value.
