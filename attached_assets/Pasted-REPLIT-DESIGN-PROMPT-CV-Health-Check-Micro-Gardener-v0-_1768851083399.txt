REPLIT DESIGN PROMPT — “CV Health Check Micro-Gardener v0”

Design a clean, minimal prototype for a very simple CV-analysis tool.
The interface should feel familiar to HR/engineering managers (CREADIS context), with no exotic AI theatrics.
It must look like a normal internal productivity tool — calm, structured, helpful.

CORE FLOW

User uploads a CV (PDF or DOCX).

System shows a subtle “scanning” animation over a CV preview panel.

After a few seconds, three clear sections appear:

Strengths Observed (5 concise bullets)

Suggestions for Improvement (5 concise bullets)

Optional Rewrite Sample (one rewritten paragraph)

At the bottom, include a quiet CTA button:

“Suggest role alignment draft”

This CTA should feel optional and non-threatening.

LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS

A single-page layout.

Left: CV preview pane (scrollable).

Right: Three stacked result boxes with gentle dividers.

A subtle activity indicator that moves across the CV (e.g., a faint scanning bar).

Use a neutral palette: greys, whites, one accent color.

No scores, no grades, no ratings.

The absence of scoring must feel intentional, not unfinished.

TONE OF THE INTERFACE

Professional, calm, helpful.

No AI mascots, no quirky metaphors, no “Gardener” branding yet.

This is a tool that should feel like it could already exist inside CREADIS today.

COPY GUIDELINES

Use plain enterprise language:

“Upload CV”

“Analyzing…”

“Strengths observed”

“Suggestions for improvement”

“Optional rewrite sample”

Avoid anything mystical, evaluative, or judgmental.

INTERACTION DETAILS

When the CV is uploaded, immediately show the scanning animation.

After 3–6 seconds, fade in the three sections with a sense of quiet precision.

The rewrite sample should appear in a code-block-style box with a light background.

GOAL OF THIS DESIGN

Create a tangible, low-risk, immediately valuable first iteration that:

delivers instant insight,

helps the user improve a CV,

hints at deeper intelligence,

does not scare enterprise stakeholders.

Keep everything simple, legible, and grounded.
